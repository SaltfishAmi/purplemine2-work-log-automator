## WFH log automator

> last updated May 2022

A userscript to help automate the process of filing work time logs in WFH scenarios, for `redmine` with `Purplemine2` theme.

### Usage

1. Download and install the script to your userscript manager. It is tested and confirmed to work with latest Tampermonkey on Firefox. **Don't** install it in an automatically updatable manner, because you will need to put your personalized configurations in the script file itself, which would otherwise be overwritten.
2. Edit the script in your userscript manager. Jump to the config section and modify the values to fit your needs.
3. Bookmark `http(s)://{redmine_root}/projects/{project_group_name}/issues`
4. PROFIT
